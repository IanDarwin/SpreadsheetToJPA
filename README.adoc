= Spreadsheet To Database via POI and JPA

This is a rough outline of a project to read a spreadsheet using Apache POI
and write it into a database using the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA).

There is a lot of code that is specific to our particular spreadsheet.

The persistence.xml file is omitted as it contains my database password and other info.

As well, the JPA entity class isn't included as it's in a dependant project, but
the Member class is pretty obvious, and you probably already have one like it if
you're needing to convert a spreadsheet into it.
