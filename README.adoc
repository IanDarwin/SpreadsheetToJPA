= Spreadsheet To JPA Entity

This project reads a spreadsheet using Apache POI and writes it into a database using the
Java Persistence Architecture (JPA).

There is a lot of code that is specific to our particular spreadsheet.

As well, the JPA entity class isn't included as it's in a dependant project, but
the Member class is pretty obvious, and you probably already have one like it if
you're needing to convert a spreadsheet into it.
