= Spreadsheet To Database via POI and JPA

This is a rough outline of a quick hack to read a spreadsheet using Apache POI
and write it into a database using the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA).

There is a lot of code that is specific to our particular spreadsheet and database.
Please *do not expect this either to compile or work as it stands*.

The _persistence.xml_ file is omitted as it contains my database password and other info.

As well, the JPA entity class isn't included as it's in a dependant project, but
the Member class is pretty obvious, and you probably already have one like it if
you're needing to convert a spreadsheet into it.
